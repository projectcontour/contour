# Lychee Ignore File for Contour Documentation Link Checks

# Purpose:
# - Avoid false positives from placeholder/dev links
# - Ignore dynamic GitHub URLs that cannot be validated reliably
# - Reduce CI noise while still catching real broken links

# Local development links (not valid in CI)
localhost

# Placeholder/example domains used in docs

example.org

# Mail links are not checkable as HTTP URLs
mailto:*

# GitHub issue creation links are dynamic and often return redirects
https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/issues/new*
https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/issues?q=*

# GitHub compare URLs are temporary/dynamic
https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/compare/*

# Common documentation short-links that may rate-limit bots
