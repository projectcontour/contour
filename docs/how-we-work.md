This page captures how we work on Contour.

- When you pick up an issue, assign it to yourself.
When you stop working, unassigned yourself.
While you hold an issue, you are responsible for giving status reports on it; over communicate, don’t let others speak for you, or worse, guess.

- Don't work on an issue assigned to someone else. If you think they're overcomitted or stuck, please ask.

- Don't assign an issue to someone else without talking to them directly.

- Hoarding issues is not saving for a rainy day, you can only work on one thing at a time, you should avoid holding more than one issue at a time.

- Everyone is responsible for code reviews.
If someone asks you for a review, or they use GitHub for the same, you should aim to review it (timezones permitting) promptly.
Your aim is to give feedback, not land the as soon as you are asked to review it.

- The smaller the change, the better the PR process works.
Everything flows from this statement.

- [Talk about what you intend to do, then do the thing you talked about.](https://dave.cheney.net/2019/02/18/talk-then-code)
GitHub review tools suck for extended debate, if you find you’re taking past your reviewer, its a sign that more design is needed.

- Log an issue or it didn’t happen. 

- Before you fix a bug, write a test to show you fixed it.

- Before you add a feature, write a test so someone else doesn’t break your feature by accident. 

- You are permitted to refactor as much as you like to achieve these goals.
