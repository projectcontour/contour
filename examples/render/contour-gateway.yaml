                    conditions, with two extra fields to hold sub-conditions, which
                    provide more detailed reasons for the state (True or False) of
                    the condition. \n `errors` holds information about sub-conditions
                    which are fatal to that condition and render its state False.
                    \n `warnings` holds information about sub-conditions which are
                    not fatal to that condition and do not force the state to be False.
                    \n Remember that Conditions have a type, a status, and a reason.
                    \n The type is the type of the condition, the most important one
                    in this CRD set is `Valid`. `Valid` is a positive-polarity condition:
                    when it is `status: true` there are no problems. \n In more detail,
                    `status: true` means that the object is has been ingested into
                    Contour with no errors. `warnings` may still be present, and will
                    be indicated in the Reason field. There must be zero entries in
                    the `errors` slice in this case. \n `Valid`, `status: false` means
                    that the object has had one or more fatal errors during processing
                    into Contour.  The details of the errors will be present under
                    the `errors` field. There must be at least one error in the `errors`
                    slice if `status` is `false`. \n For DetailedConditions of types
                    other than `Valid`, the Condition must be in the negative polarity.
                    When they have `status` `true`, there is an error. There must
                    be at least one entry in the `errors` Subcondition slice. When
                    they have `status` `false`, there are no serious errors, and there
                    must be zero entries in the `errors` slice. In either case, there
                    may be entries in the `warnings` slice. \n Regardless of the polarity,
                    the `reason` and `message` fields must be updated with either
                    the detail of the reason (if there is one and only one entry in
                    total across both the `errors` and `warnings` slices), or `MultipleReasons`

                        a cluster resource (i.e. Service) by externally-reachable
                        URL, load-balance traffic and terminate SSL/TLS.  Typically,
                        a route is a \"HTTPRoute\" or \"TCPRoute\" in group \"networking.x-k8s.io\",
                        however, an implementation may support other types of resources.

                        Protocol field. \n Although a client request may technically
                        match multiple route rules, only one rule may ultimately receive
                        the request. Matching precedence MUST be determined in order

                        example, the most specific HTTPRoute match   is determined
                        by the longest matching combination of hostname and path.
                        * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example,
                        a Route with   a creation timestamp of \"2020-09-08 01:02:03\"
                        is given precedence over   a Route with a creation timestamp
                        of \"2020-09-08 01:02:04\". * If everything else is equivalent,
                        the Route appearing first in   alphabetical order (namespace/name)
                        should be given precedence. For   example, foo/bar is given
                        precedence over foo/baz. \n All valid portions of a Route

                        MUST be determined in order of the following criteria, continuing
                        on ties: \n * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
                        For example, a Route with   a creation timestamp of \"2020-09-08
                        01:02:03\" is given precedence over   a Route with a creation
                        timestamp of \"2020-09-08 01:02:04\". * The Route appearing
                        first in alphabetical order by   \"<namespace>/<name>\". For
                        example, foo/bar is given precedence over   foo/baz. \n If
                        ties still exist within the Route that has been given precedence,
                        matching precedence MUST be granted to the first matching
                        rule meeting the above criteria."
