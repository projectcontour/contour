                  description: "DetailedCondition is an extension of the normal Kubernetes
                    conditions, with two extra fields to hold sub-conditions, which
                    provide more detailed reasons for the state (True or False) of
                    the condition. \n `errors` holds information about sub-conditions
                    which are fatal to that condition and render its state False.
                    \n `warnings` holds information about sub-conditions which are
                    not fatal to that condition and do not force the state to be False.
                    \n Remember that Conditions have a type, a status, and a reason.
                    \n The type is the type of the condition, the most important one
                    in this CRD set is `Valid`. `Valid` is a positive-polarity condition:
                    when it is `status: true` there are no problems. \n In more detail,
                    `status: true` means that the object is has been ingested into
                    Contour with no errors. `warnings` may still be present, and will
                    be indicated in the Reason field. There must be zero entries in
                    the `errors` slice in this case. \n `Valid`, `status: false` means
                    that the object has had one or more fatal errors during processing
                    into Contour. The details of the errors will be present under
                    the `errors` field. There must be at least one error in the `errors`
                    slice if `status` is `false`. \n For DetailedConditions of types
                    other than `Valid`, the Condition must be in the negative polarity.
                    When they have `status` `true`, there is an error. There must
                    be at least one entry in the `errors` Subcondition slice. When
                    they have `status` `false`, there are no serious errors, and there
                    must be zero entries in the `errors` slice. In either case, there
                    may be entries in the `warnings` slice. \n Regardless of the polarity,
                    the `reason` and `message` fields must be updated with either
                    the detail of the reason (if there is one and only one entry in
                    total across both the `errors` and `warnings` slices), or `MultipleReasons`
                    if there is more than one entry."

                                  pod is marked as deleted. The update starts by launching
                                  new pods on 30% of nodes. Once an updated pod is
                                  available (Ready for at least minReadySeconds) the
                                  old DaemonSet pod on that node is marked deleted.
                                  If the old pod becomes unavailable for any reason
                                  (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is drained)
                                  an updated pod is immediatedly created on that node
                                  without considering surge limits. Allowing surge
                                  implies the possibility that the resources consumed
                                  by the daemonset on any given node can double if
                                  the readiness check fails, and so resource intensive
                                  daemonsets should take into account that they may
                                  cause evictions during disruption.'

                                        the functionality of the dataSource field
                                        and as such if both fields are non-empty,
                                        they must have the same value. For backwards
                                        compatibility, when namespace isn''t specified
                                        in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource
                                        and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                        value automatically if one of them is empty
                                        and the other is non-empty. When namespace
                                        is specified in dataSourceRef, dataSource
                                        isn''t set to the same value and must be empty.
                                        There are three important differences between
                                        dataSource and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource
                                        only allows two specific types of objects,
                                        dataSourceRef allows any non-core object,
                                        as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                        * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                                        (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all
                                        values, and generates an error if a disallowed
                                        value is specified. * While dataSource only
                                        allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows
                                        objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this

                    conditions, with two extra fields to hold sub-conditions, which
                    provide more detailed reasons for the state (True or False) of
                    the condition. \n `errors` holds information about sub-conditions
                    which are fatal to that condition and render its state False.
                    \n `warnings` holds information about sub-conditions which are
                    not fatal to that condition and do not force the state to be False.
                    \n Remember that Conditions have a type, a status, and a reason.
                    \n The type is the type of the condition, the most important one
                    in this CRD set is `Valid`. `Valid` is a positive-polarity condition:
                    when it is `status: true` there are no problems. \n In more detail,
                    `status: true` means that the object is has been ingested into
                    Contour with no errors. `warnings` may still be present, and will
                    be indicated in the Reason field. There must be zero entries in
                    the `errors` slice in this case. \n `Valid`, `status: false` means
                    that the object has had one or more fatal errors during processing
                    into Contour. The details of the errors will be present under
                    the `errors` field. There must be at least one error in the `errors`
                    slice if `status` is `false`. \n For DetailedConditions of types
                    other than `Valid`, the Condition must be in the negative polarity.
                    When they have `status` `true`, there is an error. There must
                    be at least one entry in the `errors` Subcondition slice. When
                    they have `status` `false`, there are no serious errors, and there
                    must be zero entries in the `errors` slice. In either case, there
                    may be entries in the `warnings` slice. \n Regardless of the polarity,
                    the `reason` and `message` fields must be updated with either
                    the detail of the reason (if there is one and only one entry in
                    total across both the `errors` and `warnings` slices), or `MultipleReasons`
                    if there is more than one entry."

                    \n The type is the type of the condition, the most important one

                    `status: true` means that the object is has been ingested into
                    Contour with no errors. `warnings` may still be present, and will
                    be indicated in the Reason field. There must be zero entries in
                    the `errors` slice in this case. \n `Valid`, `status: false` means
                    that the object has had one or more fatal errors during processing
                    into Contour. The details of the errors will be present under

                    slice if `status` is `false`. \n For DetailedConditions of types
                    other than `Valid`, the Condition must be in the negative polarity.
                    When they have `status` `true`, there is an error. There must
                    be at least one entry in the `errors` Subcondition slice. When
                    they have `status` `false`, there are no serious errors, and there
                    must be zero entries in the `errors` slice. In either case, there
                    may be entries in the `warnings` slice. \n Regardless of the polarity,
                    the `reason` and `message` fields must be updated with either

                    be indicated in the Reason field. There must be zero entries in
                    the `errors` slice in this case. \n `Valid`, `status: false` means
                    that the object has had one or more fatal errors during processing
                    into Contour. The details of the errors will be present under

                    other than `Valid`, the Condition must be in the negative polarity.
                    When they have `status` `true`, there is an error. There must
                    be at least one entry in the `errors` Subcondition slice. When

                    must be zero entries in the `errors` slice. In either case, there

                  must have a unique combination of Hostname, Port, and Protocol.
                  \n An implementation MAY group Listeners by Port and then collapse
                  each group of Listeners into a single Listener if the implementation

                  implementation MAY also group together and collapse compatible Listeners
                  belonging to different Gateways. \n For example, an implementation
                  might consider Listeners to be compatible with each other if all
                  of the following conditions are met: \n 1. Either each Listener

                  within the group specifies either    the \"HTTPS\" or \"TLS\" Protocol.
                  \n 2. Each Listener within the group specifies a Hostname that is
                  unique    within the group. \n 3. As a special case, one Listener
                  within a group may omit Hostname,    in which case this Listener
                  matches when no other Listener    matches. \n If the implementation
                  does collapse compatible Listeners, the hostname provided in the
                  incoming client request MUST be matched to a Listener to find the

                  the Hostname field for each Listener in order of most to least specific.
                  That is, exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches.
                  \n If this field specifies multiple Listeners that have the same
                  Port value but are not compatible, the implementation must raise
                  a \"Conflicted\" condition in the Listener status. \n Support: Core"

                        the rest of the rules within that Route should still be supported.

                  implementation MAY also group together and collapse compatible Listeners
                  belonging to different Gateways. \n For example, an implementation
                  might consider Listeners to be compatible with each other if all
                  of the following conditions are met: \n 1. Either each Listener

                  within the group specifies either    the \"HTTPS\" or \"TLS\" Protocol.
                  \n 2. Each Listener within the group specifies a Hostname that is
                  unique    within the group. \n 3. As a special case, one Listener
                  within a group may omit Hostname,    in which case this Listener

                  That is, exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches.
                  \n If this field specifies multiple Listeners that have the same
                  Port value but are not compatible, the implementation must raise

          MUST accept HTTP/2 connections without an initial upgrade from HTTP/1.1,

                  This matches the RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with 2 notable
                  exceptions: \n 1. IPs are not allowed. 2. A hostname may be prefixed
                  with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard    label MUST appear

                  the Listener and GRPCRoute, there MUST be at least one intersecting
                  hostname for the GRPCRoute to be attached to the Listener. For example:
                  \n * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches
                  GRPCRoutes   that have either not specified any hostnames, or have

                  \  that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified
                  at least   one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For
                  example,   `test.example.com` and `*.example.com` would both match.
                  On the other   hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would
                  not match. \n Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label
                  (`*.`) are interpreted as a suffix match. That means that a match

                  but not `example.com`. \n If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have
                  specified hostnames, any GRPCRoute hostnames that do not match the
                  Listener hostname MUST be ignored. For example, if a Listener specified
                  `*.example.com`, and the GRPCRoute specified `test.example.com`
                  and `test.example.net`, `test.example.net` MUST NOT be considered
                  for a match. \n If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have specified
                  hostnames, and none match with the criteria above, then the GRPCRoute
                  MUST NOT be accepted by the implementation. The implementation MUST
                  raise an 'Accepted' Condition with a status of `False` in the corresponding
                  RouteParentStatus. \n If a Route (A) of type HTTPRoute or GRPCRoute
                  is attached to a Listener and that listener already has another
                  Route (B) of the other type attached and the intersection of the
                  hostnames of A and B is non-empty, then the implementation MUST

                  criteria, in order: \n * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.

                                    be resolved, the filter MUST NOT be skipped. Instead,

                  would   all match. On the other hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net`
                  would   not match. \n Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard
                  label (`*.`) are interpreted as a suffix match. That means that
                  a match for `*.example.com` would match both `test.example.com`,
                  and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`. \n If both the
                  Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, any HTTPRoute hostnames
                  that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be ignored. For example,
                  if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the HTTPRoute specified
                  `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`, `test.example.net` must
                  not be considered for a match. \n If both the Listener and HTTPRoute
                  have specified hostnames, and none match with the criteria above,
                  then the HTTPRoute is not accepted. The implementation must raise
                  an 'Accepted' Condition with a status of `False` in the corresponding
                  RouteParentStatus. \n In the event that multiple HTTPRoutes specify
                  intersecting hostnames (e.g. overlapping wildcard matching and exact
                  matching hostnames), precedence must be given to rules from the
                  HTTPRoute with the largest number of: \n * Characters in a matching
                  non-wildcard hostname. * Characters in a matching hostname. \n If
                  ties exist across multiple Routes, the matching precedence rules

                                    must support core filters. \n - Extended: Filter
                                    types and their corresponding configuration defined
                                    by   \"Support: Extended\" in this package, e.g.

                                    to support extended filters. \n - Implementation-specific:

                                    vendors.   In the future, filters showing convergence

                                    core   conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration
                                    for such filters   is specified using the ExtensionRef
                                    field. `Type` should be set to   \"ExtensionRef\"

                                    the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

                                    be resolved, the filter MUST NOT be skipped. Instead,
                                    requests that would have been processed by that
                                    filter MUST receive a HTTP error response. \n

                                            When specified, a trailing `/` is ignored.
                                            For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`,
                                            and `/abc/def` would all match the prefix

                  hostname for the HTTPRoute to be attached to the Listener. For example:

                  would   not match. \n Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard
                  label (`*.`) are interpreted as a suffix match. That means that

                  Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, any HTTPRoute hostnames
                  that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be ignored. For example,
                  if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the HTTPRoute specified
                  `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`, `test.example.net` must
                  not be considered for a match. \n If both the Listener and HTTPRoute

                  RouteParentStatus. \n In the event that multiple HTTPRoutes specify
                  intersecting hostnames (e.g. overlapping wildcard matching and exact
                  matching hostnames), precedence must be given to rules from the

                        generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                        all listeners listening on the specified port that also support
                        this kind of Route(and select this Route). It's not recommended
                        to set `Port` unless the networking behaviors specified in
                        a Route must apply to a specific port as opposed to a listener(s)
                        whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port and SectionName
                        are specified, the name and port of the selected listener

                        is considered successful as long as the parent resource accepts

                                    e.g. \"RequestHeaderModifier\". All   implementations
                                    must support core filters. \n - Extended: Filter
                                    types and their corresponding configuration defined
                                    by   \"Support: Extended\" in this package, e.g.
                                    \"RequestMirror\". Implementers   are encouraged
                                    to support extended filters. \n - Implementation-specific:
                                    Filters that are defined and supported by   specific
                                    vendors.   In the future, filters showing convergence

                                    will be considered for inclusion in extended or
                                    core   conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration
                                    for such filters   is specified using the ExtensionRef
                                    field. `Type` should be set to   \"ExtensionRef\"

                                    the core API with implementation-specific behavior.
                                    \n If a reference to a custom filter type cannot
                                    be resolved, the filter MUST NOT be skipped. Instead,
                                    requests that would have been processed by that
                                    filter MUST receive a HTTP error response. \n

                              vendors.   In the future, filters showing convergence

                              behavior. \n If a reference to a custom filter type

                        is satisfied. \n For example, take the following matches configuration:
                        \n ``` matches: - path:     value: \"/foo\"   headers:   -
                        name: \"version\"     value: \"v2\" - path:     value: \"/v2/foo\"
                        ``` \n For a request to match against this rule, a request
                        must satisfy EITHER of the two conditions: \n - path prefixed
                        with `/foo` AND contains the header `version: v2` - path prefix
                        of `/v2/foo` \n See the documentation for HTTPRouteMatch on
                        how to specify multiple match conditions that should be ANDed
                        together. \n If no matches are specified, the default is a
                        prefix path match on \"/\", which has the effect of matching
                        every HTTP request. \n Proxy or Load Balancer routing configuration
                        generated from HTTPRoutes MUST prioritize matches based on
                        the following criteria, continuing on ties. Across all rules
                        specified on applicable Routes, precedence must be given to
                        the match with the largest number of: \n * Characters in a
                        matching path. * Header matches. * Query param matches. \n
                        If ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence
                        MUST be determined in order of the following criteria, continuing
                        on ties: \n * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
                        * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by   \"{namespace}/{name}\".

                        with a match meeting the above criteria. \n When no rules
                        matching a request have been successfully attached to the
                        parent a request is coming from, a HTTP 404 status code MUST

                  that a Route wants to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent
                  resource needs to allow this for the attachment to be complete.
                  For Gateways, that means the Gateway needs to allow attachment from
                  Routes of this kind and namespace. \n The only kind of parent resource
                  with \"Core\" support is Gateway. This API may be extended in the
                  future to support additional kinds of parent resources such as one
                  of the route kinds. \n It is invalid to reference an identical parent
                  more than once. It is valid to reference multiple distinct sections
                  within the same parent resource, such as 2 Listeners within a Gateway.
                  \n It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects
                  that may be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations
                  may choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that
                  is the case, the list of routes attached to those resources should
                  also be merged. \n Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace
                  boundaries, there are specific rules. Cross-namespace references
                  are only valid if they are explicitly allowed by something in the
                  namespace they are referring to. For example, Gateway has the AllowedRoutes
                  field, and ReferenceGrant provides a generic way to enable any other

                  must be at least one intersecting hostname for the TLSRoute to be

                  any hostnames, or have specified at   least one of `test.example.com`

                  For Gateways, that means the Gateway needs to allow attachment from

                  \n It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects
                  that may be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations

                            It can be interpreted differently based on the type of
                            parent resource. \n When the parent resource is a Gateway,
                            this targets all listeners listening on the specified
                            port that also support this kind of Route(and select this
                            Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                            networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to
                            a specific port as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s)
                            may be changed. When both Port and SectionName are specified,
                            the name and port of the selected listener must match
                            both specified values. \n Implementations MAY choose to
                            support other parent resources. Implementations supporting
                            other types of parent resources MUST clearly document
                            how/if Port is interpreted. \n For the purpose of status,
                            an attachment is considered successful as long as the
                            parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them
                            by Route kind, namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway
                            listeners accept attachment from the referencing Route,
                            the Route MUST be considered successfully attached. If
                            no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                            the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                            must match both specified values. \n Implementations MAY
                            choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                            If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName
