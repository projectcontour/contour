# Major Changes

## Gateway API

### Added Initial Support for TLSRoute
PR https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/3627 added support for TLSRoute to enable Passthrough TCP Proxying to pods via SNI. See https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/issues/3440 for additional information on TLSRoute feature requirements.

### GatewayClass Support
PR https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/3659 added GatewayClass support through the gateway.controllerName configuration parameter. The gateway.namespace and gateway.name parameters are required when setting gateway.controllerName. When the cluster contains Gateway API CRDs and this parameter is set, Contour will reconcile GatewayClass resources with the spec.controller field that matches gateway.controllerName. ControllerName should take the form of `projectcontour.io/<namespace>/contour`, where `<namespace>` is the namespace that Contour runs in.

## CA is No Longer Ignored when Downstream "Skip Verify" is True
With PR https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/3661, Contour will no longer ignore a certificate under the following conditions:
  - If no CA is set and "skip verify" is true, client certs are not required by Envoy.
  - If CA set and "skip verify" is true, client certs are required by Envoy.
  - CA is still required if "skip verify" is false.
  - `caCert` is now optional since skipClientCertValidation can be true. PR https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/3658 added an `omitempty` JSON tag to omit the `caCert` field when serializing to JSON and it hasn't been specified.  

## Website Update
PR https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/3704 revamps the Contour website based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Check out the fresh new look and tell us what you think.

# Deprecation & Removal Notices
- PR https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/3642 removed the `experimental-service-apis` flag has been removed. The gateway.name & gateway.namespace in the Contour configuration file should be used for configuring Gateway API (formerly Service APIs).
- PR https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/pull/3645 removed support for Ingress v1beta1. Ingress v1 resources should be used with Contour.
