# Major Changes

## Overload Manager

It is now possible to enable Envoy overload manager to avoid traffic disturbances when Envoy process allocates too much heap and is terminated by the Linux out-of-memory manager.
The feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by following [instructions here](https://projectcontour.io/docs/main/config/overload-manager/).

(#4597, @tsaarni)

## JWT Verification Support

Contour's HTTPProxy now supports configuring Envoy's [JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication filter](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/security/jwt_authn_filter), for verifying JWTs on incoming requests.

A root HTTPProxy can optionally define one or more JWT providers, each of which can define an issuer, audiences, and a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) to use for verifying JWTs.

JWT providers can then be applied as requirements to routes on the HTTPProxy (or routes on [included HTTPProxies](https://projectcontour.io/docs/main/config/inclusion-delegation/)), either by setting one provider as the default, or by explicitly specifying a JWT provider to require for a given route.
Individual routes may also opt out of JWT verification if a default provider has been set for the HTTPProxy.

For more information, see:
- [JWT verification documentation](https://projectcontour.io/docs/main/config/jwt-verification)
- [JWTProvider API documentation](https://projectcontour.io/docs/main/config/api/#projectcontour.io/v1.JWTProvider)
- [JWTVerificationPolicy API documentation](https://projectcontour.io/docs/main/config/api/#projectcontour.io/v1.JWTVerificationPolicy)

## Slow start mode

Slow start mode is a configuration setting that is used to gradually increase the amount of traffic targeted to a newly added upstream endpoint.
This can be useful for example with JVM based applications, that might otherwise get overwhelmed during JIT warm-up period.
For more information [see here](https://projectcontour.io/docs/main/config/slow-start/).

# Minor Changes

## HTTPProxy CORS policy supports regex matching on Allowed Origins

The AllowOrigin field of the HTTPProxy CORSPolicy can be configured as a regex to enable more flexibility for users.
More advanced matching can now be performed on the `Origin` header of HTTP requests, instead of restricting users to allow all origins, or enumerating all possible values.
