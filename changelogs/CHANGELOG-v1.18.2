We are delighted to present version 1.18.2 of Contour, our layer 7 HTTP reverse proxy for Kubernetes clusters.

# Fixes

## Performance Fix for Processing Config

#4061 Fixes a performance issue in Contour's config processing. This issue primarily impacted users with very large numbers of HTTPProxies/Ingresses/Services, who were seeing Contour take up to a minute or two to process additional configuration. With this fix, processing times should be significantly improved for users with many resources. See #4058 and #4061 for additional information.

# Upgrading

Instructions for upgrading to Contour 1.18.2 can be found [here](https://projectcontour.io/resources/upgrading/).
