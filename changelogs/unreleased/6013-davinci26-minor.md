## Support for Global Circuit Breaker Policy

The way [circuit-breaker-annotations](https://projectcontour.io/docs/1.27/config/annotations/) work currently is that when not present they are being defaulted to Envoy defaults. The Envoy defaults can be quite low for larger clusters with more traffic so if a user accidentally deletes them or unset them this cause an issue. With this change we are providing contour administrators the ability to provide global defaults that are good. In that case even if the user forgets to set them or deletes them they can have the safety net of good defaults. They can be configured via [cluster.circuit-breakers](https://projectcontour.io/docs/1.28/configuration/#circuit-breakers)  or via `ContourConfiguration`` CRD in [spec.envoy.cluster.circuitBreakers](https://projectcontour.io/docs/1.28/config/api/#projectcontour.io/v1alpha1.GlobalCircuitBreakerDefaults)
