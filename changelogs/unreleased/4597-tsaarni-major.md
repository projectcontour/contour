## Overload Manager

It is now possible to enable Envoy overload manager to avoid traffic disturbances when Envoy process allocates too much heap and is terminated by the Linux out-of-memory manager.
The feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by following [instructions here](https://projectcontour.io/docs/main/config/overload-manager/).
