## Update to Gateway API v0.5.0

Contour now supports Gateway API v0.5.0, including both the v1alpha2 and v1beta1 API versions.

With this update, Contour passes all of the Gateway API v0.5.0 conformance tests, which cover much of the core API surface (but are not yet 100% exhaustive).

For more information on the Gateway API v0.5.0 release, see [the release blog post](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/blog/2022/graduating-to-beta/).

For information on getting started with Contour and Gateway API, see the [Contour/Gateway API guide](https://projectcontour.io/guides/gateway-api/).
