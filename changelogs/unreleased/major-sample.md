## Sample Major Change

This change goes at the top of the changelog, and calls out major changes
that require user action. Note that it's heading level 2.

It must include a few paragraphs explaining what the change is, why we made the
change, preferably with a link to the design document involved, and what the
Contour user should do about it.

If the change is a breaking one, this document should also include instructions
on what to do, preferably with copy-pastable commands to do it.
