## Contour xDS server implementation is now deprecated

As of this release, the `contour` xDS server implementation is now deprecated.
Once the go-control-plane based `envoy` xDS server has had sufficient production bake time, the `contour` implementation will be removed from Contour.
Notification of removal will occur at least one release in advance.
