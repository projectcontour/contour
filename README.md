# contour - Docs Branch

This special branch (`gh-pages`) is used to generate the [public documentation site](https://heptio.github.io/contour)
for contour. This site is hosted using [Github Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/).

Most of these files were autogenerated using the [`doc-site-gen` tool](https://github.com/heptio/doc-site-gen). To learn how to add new
versions to this site, update `master`, enable/disable versions, or generate a new docs site, see the [official README](https://github.com/heptio/doc-site-gen/README.md).
