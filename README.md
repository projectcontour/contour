## Overview

Contour is an Ingress controller for Kubernetes that works by deploying the [Envoy proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) as a reverse proxy and load balancer.
Contour supports dynamic configuration updates out of the box while maintaining a lightweight profile.

Contour also introduces a new ingress API ([HTTPProxy](https://projectcontour.io/docs/main/config/fundamentals/)) which is implemented via a Custom Resource Definition (CRD).
Its goal is to expand upon the functionality of the Ingress API to allow for a richer user experience as well as solve shortcomings in the original design.

## Prerequisites

See the [compatibility matrix](https://projectcontour.io/resources/compatibility-matrix/) for the Kubernetes versions Contour is supported with.

RBAC must be enabled on your cluster.

## Get started

Getting started with Contour is as simple as one command.
See the [Getting Started](https://projectcontour.io/getting-started) document.
