## Thanks for contributing to Contour!

Please delete this text between the `---` strings (and the strings themselves) before submitting your PR.

Before submitting a pull request, make sure you read about our Contribution Workflow here: https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#contribution-workflow

Some notable call outs from our Contribution Workflow:
- All PR's must have a `Fixes #NNN` or `Updates #NNN` line in the pull request description.
- All PR's must add a `release-note/category` label, where category is one of `major`, `minor`, `small`, `docs`, `infra`,`deprecation`, or `none-required`.
- Contour operates according to the talk, then code rule.
- If you plan to submit a pull request for anything more than a typo or small bug fix, first you should raise an issue to discuss your proposal, before submitting any code.
- We generally won't merge a PR without an associated issue.
- Large changes must have an associated design document, raising an issue with your proposed change will give us a chance to determine if the change needs a design doc.
- All commits to Contour must have a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) sign off. More about that here https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#dco-sign-off
