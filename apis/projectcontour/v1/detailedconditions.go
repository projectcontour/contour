// and should be removed when they are not relevant.

// TODO(youngnick): Replace the inlined Condition with metav1.Condition once we have moved to a client-go
// version that includes it. Also includes deleting kubeconditions.go.

// DetailedCondition is an extension of the normal Kubernetes conditions, with two extra
// fields to hold sub-conditions, which provide more detailed reasons for the state (True or False)
// of the condition.
//
// `errors` holds information about sub-conditions which are fatal to that condition and render its state False.
//
// `warnings` holds information about sub-conditions which are not fatal to that condition and do not force the state to be False.
//
// Remember that Conditions have a type, a status, and a reason.
//
// The type is the type of the condition, the most important one in this CRD set is `Valid`.
// `Valid` is a positive-polarity condition: when it is `status: true` there are no problems.
//
// In more detail, `status: true` means that the object is has been ingested into Contour with no errors.
// `warnings` may still be present, and will be indicated in the Reason field. There must be zero entries in the `errors`
// slice in this case.
//
// `Valid`, `status: false` means that the object has had one or more fatal errors during processing into Contour.
//  The details of the errors will be present under the `errors` field. There must be at least one error in the `errors`
// slice if `status` is `false`.
//
// For DetailedConditions of types other than `Valid`, the Condition must be in the negative polarity.
// When they have `status` `true`, there is an error. There must be at least one entry in the `errors` Subcondition slice.
// When they have `status` `false`, there are no serious errors, and there must be zero entries in the `errors` slice.
// In either case, there may be entries in the `warnings` slice.
//
// Regardless of the polarity, the `reason` and `message` fields must be updated with either the detail of the reason
// (if there is one and only one entry in total across both the `errors` and `warnings` slices), or
// `MultipleReasons` if there is more than one entry.
