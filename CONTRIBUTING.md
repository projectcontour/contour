Guidelines in this document still apply to website contributions.

If you want to get more insight into how the Contour maintainer team approaches R&D, this [page](https://projectcontour.io/resources/how-we-work/) captures how we work on Contour.

## Building from source

This section describes how to build Contour from source.

### Prerequisites

1. *Install Go*

    Contour generally uses the most recent minor [Go version][1].
    Look in the `Makefile` (search for the `BUILD_BASE_IMAGE` variable) to find the specific version being used.

### Fetch the source

Contour uses [`go modules`][2] for dependency management.

1. [Fork][3] the repo

2. Create a local clone

```
git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/contour.git
```

### Building

To build Contour, run:

```
make
```

This uses a `go install` and produces a `contour` binary in your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.


### Running the unit tests

Once you have Contour building, you can run all the unit tests for the project:

```
make check
```

To run the tests for a single package, change to package directory and run:

```
go test .
```

### Lint

Before making a commit, it's always a good idea to check the code for common programming mistakes, misspellings and other potential errors. The lint checks can be run by invoking the make lint task:

```shell
make lint
```

Note: The lint tasks require the [codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell) application. Be sure to install version 2.0 or newer before running the lint tasks.

### Local Development/Testing

It's very helpful to be able to test out changes to Contour locally without building images and pushing into clusters.

To accomplish this, Envoy can be run inside a Kubernetes cluster, typically a `kind` cluster.
Then Contour is run on your local machine and Envoy will be configured to look for Contour running on your machine vs running in the cluster.

1. Create a kind cluster

```shell
kind create cluster --config=./examples/kind/kind-expose-port.yaml --name=contour
```

2. Deploy Contour & Deps to cluster:

```shell
kubectl apply -f examples/contour
```

_Note: The Contour Deployment/Service can be deleted if desired since it's not used._

3. Find IP of local machine (e.g. `ifconfig` or similar depending on your environment)

4. Edit Envoy Daemonset & change the xds-server value to your local IP address
```shell
kubectl edit ds envoy -n projectcontour
```

Change `initContainers:` to look like this updating the IP and removing the three envoy cert flags:
```shell
 initContainers:
  - args:
    - bootstrap
    - /config/envoy.json
    - --xds-address=<YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>
    - --xds-port=8001
    - --xds-resource-version=v3
    - --resources-dir=/config/resources
```

5. Change your Contour code.

6. Build & start Contour allowing Envoy to connect and get its configuration. 
```shell
make install && contour serve --kubeconfig=$HOME/.kube/config --xds-address=0.0.0.0 --insecure 
```

8. Test using the local kind cluster by deploying resources into that cluster. Many of our examples use `local.projectcontour.io` which is configured to point to `127.0.0.1` which allows requests to route to the local kind cluster for easy testing.

7. Make more changes and repeat step #6.

## Contribution workflow

This section describes the process for contributing a bug fix or new feature.
It follows from the previous section, so if you haven't set up your Go workspace and built Contour from source, do that first.

### Before you submit a pull request

This project operates according to the _talk, then code_ rule.
If you plan to submit a pull request for anything more than a typo or obvious bug fix, first you _should_ [raise an issue][6] to discuss your proposal, before submitting any code.

Depending on the size of the feature you may be expected to first write a design proposal. Follow the [Proposal Process](https://github.com/projectcontour/community/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md#proposal-process) documented in Contour's Governance.

### Issue and PR Triage

#### Project Board

In addition to maintaining the project repositories, project maintainers are responsible for maintaining the [project tracking board](https://github.com/orgs/projectcontour/projects/2).
This board is intended to organize work for the team as well as provide visibility into the status and priority of tracks of work, specific Issues, and PRs.
The board is used in conjunction with Issue and PR labels.

Priority of cards on the board flows from left to right, with the *leftmost* column representing what is currently being worked on.
Within a column, priority flows from top to bottom, with the *topmost* cards having the highest priority.

The leftmost column should represent what is planned for the upcoming release.
The "Investigating" column contains longer term items that may need more information, feedback from Issue reporters, etc.
Further columns represent decreasing priority, with "Prioritized Backlog" containing cards that are coming soon, all the way to the "Unprioritized" column which contains items currently not yet sorted.

**Notes for maintainers and contributors**
- If you are looking for work to pick up:
  - Look to the leftmost columns of the project board
  - *New contributors* can use [this shortcut link](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) to find good beginner Contour issues to work on and [this shortcut link](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour-operator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) to find Operator issues
- When a new Issue or PR is added, add it to the project board and make a best judgement on relative priority so we have a starting place in triage
- When moving items between columns, please add a comment to the Issue or PR detailing why so we have context in triage sessions

#### Community Meeting Triage

The weekly Contour [community meeting](https://projectcontour.io/community/) provides some time for the maintainer team and community to collaborate on Issue and PR triage.

Community members can add links to specific items they would like to discuss to the [meeting notes](https://hackmd.io/84Xbl4WBTpm7OBhaOAsSiw).
This time will be used for clarification, potential to bump priority in the queue of work items for the team, and the ability for contributors to provide more context to their contributions.

In addition, the meeting will be used to go over untriaged issues, longer-term items, and current progress on items in-flight as needed.

**Procedural notes**
- Once an issue has been discussed, remove and add the appropriate labels and pull the item into the correct column
- After triage, Issues and PRs that are actively being worked on should be assigned to someone. This could be:
  - the person working on the issue or PR or
  - a maintainer who is shepherding a new contributor or large PR
- Issues and PRs that are not being actively worked on should have comments updated with the current context, then be unassigned

### Commit message and PR guidelines

- Have a short subject on the first line and a body. The body can be empty.
- Use the imperative mood (ie "If applied, this commit will (subject)" should make sense).
- There must be a DCO line ("Signed-off-by: David Cheney <cheneyd@vmware.com>"), see [DCO Sign Off](#dco-sign-off) below.
- Do not merge commits that don't relate to the affected issue (e.g. "Updating from PR comments", etc). Should
the need to cherrypick a commit or rollback arise, it should be clear what a specific commit's purpose is.
- Put a summary of the main area affected by the commit at the start,
with a colon as delimiter. For example 'docs:', 'internal/(packagename):', 'design:' or something similar.
- PRs *must* be labelled with a `release-note/category` label, where category is one of
`major`, `minor`, `small`, `docs`, or `infra`, unless the change is really small, in which case
it may have a `release-note/not-required` category. PRs may also include a `release-note/deprecation`
label alone or in addition to the primary label.
- PRs *must* include a file named `changelogs/unreleased/PR#-githubID-category.md`, which is a Markdown
file with a description of the change. Please see `changelogs/unreleased/<category>-sample.md` for 
sample changelogs.
- If main has moved on, you'll need to rebase before we can merge,
so merging upstream main or rebasing from upstream before opening your
PR will probably save you some time.
- Pull requests *must* include a `Fixes #NNNN` or `Updates #NNNN` comment.
Remember that `Fixes` will close the associated issue, and `Updates` will link the PR to it.

### Merging commits

Maintainers should prefer to merge pull requests with the [Squash and merge](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits) option.
This option is preferred for a number of reasons.
First, it causes GitHub to insert the pull request number in the commit subject which makes it easier to track which PR changes landed in.
Second, it gives maintainers an opportunity to edit the commit message to conform to Contour standards and general [good practice](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
Finally, a one-to-one correspondence between pull requests and commits makes it easier to manage reverting changes and increases the reliability of bisecting the tree (since CI runs at a pull request granularity).

At a maintainer's discretion, pull requests with multiple commits can be merged with the [Create a merge commit](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges) option.
Merging pull requests with multiple commits can make sense in cases where a change involves code generation or mechanical changes that can be cleanly separated from semantic changes.
The maintainer should review commit messages for each commit and make sure that each commit builds and passes tests.

### Import Aliases

Naming is one of the most difficult things in software engineering.
Contour uses the following pattern to name imports when referencing packages from other packages.

> thing_version: The name+package path of the thing and then the version separated by underscores

Examples:

```
contour_api_v1 "github.com/projectcontour/contour/apis/projectcontour/v1"
contour_api_v1alpha1 "github.com/projectcontour/contour/apis/projectcontour/v1alpha1"
envoy_v3 "github.com/projectcontour/contour/internal/envoy/v3"
xdscache_v3 "github.com/projectcontour/contour/internal/xdscache/v3"
```   
 
### Pre commit CI

Before a change is submitted it should pass all the pre commit CI jobs.
If there are unrelated test failures the change can be merged so long as a reference to an issue that tracks the test failures is provided.

Once a change lands in main it will be built and available at this tag, `ghcr.io/projectcontour/contour:main`.
You can read more about the available contour images in the [tagging][7] document.

### Build an image

To build an image of your change using Contour's `Dockerfile`, run these commands (replacing the repository host and tag with your own):

```
docker build -t ghcr.io/davecheney/contour:latest .
docker push ghcr.io/davecheney/contour:latest
```
or, you can use the make helper, like so:

```
REGISTRY=ghcr.io/davecheney VERSION=latest make push
```

This will push to `:latest` in `ghcr.io/davecheney` obviously you'll also need to replace the repo host with your own here too. If you don't specify `VERSION`, `make push` will push to a git hash tag (the output of ` git rev-parse --short=8 --verify HEAD`).

### Verify your change

To verify your change by deploying the image you built, take one of the [deployment manifests][7], edit it to point to your new image, and deploy to your Kubernetes cluster.

## Contour testing

This section provides some useful information and guidelines for working with Contour's tests.

### Glossary

#### Config/Data Categories
* **Kubernetes Config**: `HTTPProxy`, `Ingress` or [Gateway API][8] config that Contour watches and converts to Envoy config.
* **DAG**: The internal Contour representation of L7 proxy concepts. Kubernetes config is first converted to DAG objects before being converted to Envoy config.
* **Envoy Config**: Configuration that can be provided to Envoy via xDS. This is Contour's final output, generated directly from the DAG. 

#### Test Categories
* **Unit Test**: A Go test for a particular function/package. In some cases, these test more than one package at a time.
* **Feature Test**: A Go test in `internal/featuretests` that tests the translation of Kubernetes config to Envoy config, using a Contour event handler and xDS server. 
* **End-To-End (E2E) Test**: A Go test in `test/e2e` that performs a full end-to-end test of Contour running in a cluster. Typically verifies the behavior of HTTP requests given a Kubernetes `HTTPProxy`, `Ingress` or Gateway API config.

### Summary of Major Test Suites

The following table describes the major test suites covering the core Contour processing pipeline (Kubernetes config -> DAG -> Envoy config).
In general, changes to the core processing pipeline should be accompanied by new/updated test cases in each of these test suites.

| Test Suite | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `internal/dag/builder_test.go` (specifically `TestDAGInsert*` functions) | Tests conversion of Kubernetes config to DAG objects. |
| `internal/dag/status_test.go` | Tests invalid Kubernetes (`HTTPProxy`) configs, verifying their status/conditions. |
| `internal/envoy/v3/*_test.go` | Tests conversion of DAG objects to Envoy config. |
| `internal/xdscache/v3/*_test.go` (specifically the `Test[Cluster\|Listener\|Route\|Secret]Visit` functions) | Tests conversion of Kubernetes config to Envoy config. |
| `internal/featuretests/v3/*_test.go` | Tests conversion of Kubernetes config to Envoy config, using a ~full Contour event handler and xDS server. |
| `test/e2e/[httpproxy\|gateway\|ingress]` | E2E tests with Contour running in a cluster. Verifies behavior of HTTP requests for configured proxies. |
