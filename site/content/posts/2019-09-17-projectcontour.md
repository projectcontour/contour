Times change. Summer turns to autumn, leaves fall from their branches, brands die and are reborn. The cycle of life.

Yes, it's time to wish the Heptio brand a fond farewell. As we gather on the shores to watch the pyre burn it is a time for happiness because Contour isn't dead, we've just moved house.

You might have noticed the cheery 301 redirect that GitHub sent your browser to inform it that Contour's new home is https://github.com/projectcontour/contour.
