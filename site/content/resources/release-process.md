# Minor Release Process

## Overview

A minor release is e.g. `v1.11.0`.

A minor release requires:
- website updates
- a release branch to be created
- YAML to be customized
- a release tag to be created
- an Operator release
- a GitHub release with release notes
- public communication
- cleanup


## Process

### Set environment variables

Set environment variables for use in subsequent steps:

```bash
export CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION=v1.11.0
export CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION_MAJOR=1
export CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION_MINOR=11

export KUBERNETES_MIN_VERSION=1.20
export KUBERNETES_MAX_VERSION=1.22

export CONTOUR_UPSTREAM_REMOTE_NAME=upstream
export CONTOUR_OPERATOR_UPSTREAM_REMOTE_NAME=upstream
```

### Update the website with release-specific information

1. Check out `main`, ensure it's up to date, and ensure you have a clean working directory.
1. Create a new local feature branch from `main`.
1. Generate a new set of versioned docs, plus a changelog:
    
    ```bash
    go run ./hack/release/prepare-release.go $CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION $KUBERNETES_MIN_VERSION $KUBERNETES_MAX_VERSION
    ```
1. Proofread the release notes and do any reordering, rewording, reformatting necessary, including editing or deleting the "Deprecation and Removal Notices" section.
1. Add the new release to the compatibility matrix (`site/content/resources/compatibility-matrix.md`).
1. Add the new release to the compatibility YAML (`/versions.yaml`).
1. Document upgrade instructions for the new release (`site/content/resources/upgrading.md`).
1. Commit all changes, push the branch, and PR it into `main`.

### Branch and tag release

1. Check out `main`, ensure it's up to date, and ensure you have a clean working directory.
1. Create a local release branch:

```bash
git checkout -b release-${CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION_MAJOR}.${CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION_MINOR}
```

1. Push the branch to `github.com/projectcontour/contour`:

```bash
git push --set-upstream ${CONTOUR_UPSTREAM_REMOTE_NAME} release-${CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION_MAJOR}.${CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION_MINOR}
```

1. Update the deployment YAML and create a local tag:

```bash
./hack/release/make-release-tag.sh main $CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION
```

1. Push the branch to `github.com/projectcontour/contour`:

```bash
git push ${CONTOUR_UPSTREAM_REMOTE_NAME} release-${CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION_MAJOR}.${CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION_MINOR}
```

1. Push the tag to `github.com/projectcontour/contour`:

```bash
git push ${CONTOUR_UPSTREAM_REMOTE_NAME} ${CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION}
```

### Release the operator

1. Check out `main`, ensure it's up to date, and ensure you have a clean working directory.
1. Create a local release branch:

```bash
git checkout -b release-${CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION_MAJOR}.${CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION_MINOR}
```

1. Push the branch to `github.com/projectcontour/contour-operator`:

```bash
git push --set-upstream ${CONTOUR_OPERATOR_UPSTREAM_REMOTE_NAME} release-${CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION_MAJOR}.${CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION_MINOR}
```

1. Update the deployment YAML and create a local tag:

```bash
./hack/release/make-release-tag.sh main $CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION
```

1. Push the branch to `github.com/projectcontour/contour-operator`:

```bash
git push ${CONTOUR_OPERATOR_UPSTREAM_REMOTE_NAME} release-${CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION_MAJOR}.${CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION_MINOR}
```

1. Push the tag to `github.com/projectcontour/contour-operator`:

```bash
git push ${CONTOUR_OPERATOR_UPSTREAM_REMOTE_NAME} ${CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION}
```

### Update quickstart YAML redirects

1. Check out `main`, ensure it's up to date, and ensure you have a clean working directory.
1. Create a new local feature branch from `main`.
1. Update `netlify.toml` to redirect quickstart links to the new release branch.
1. Commit all changes, push the branch, and PR it into `main`.

### Do the Github release

Now you have a tag pushed to Github, go to the release tab on github, select the tag and paste in the release notes that were generated previously.

# Patch Release Process

## Overview

A patch release is e.g. `v1.11.1`.

A patch release requires:
- patches to be cherry-picked onto the existing release branch
- website updates
- YAML to be customized
- a release tag to be created
- an Operator release
- a GitHub release with release notes
- public communication
- cleanup

## Process

### Set environment variables

Set environment variables for use in subsequent steps:

```bash
export CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION=v1.11.1
export CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION_MAJOR=1
export CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION_MINOR=11
export CONTOUR_PREVIOUS_VERSION=v1.11.0

export KUBERNETES_MIN_VERSION=1.20
export KUBERNETES_MAX_VERSION=1.22

export CONTOUR_UPSTREAM_REMOTE_NAME=upstream
export CONTOUR_OPERATOR_UPSTREAM_REMOTE_NAME=upstream
```

### Cherry-pick relevant commits into release branch

1. Get a list of commit SHAs from `main` to backport.
1. Check out the release branch for the minor version you're patching (i.e. `release-${CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION_MAJOR}.${CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION_MINOR}`), ensure it's up to date, and ensure you have a clean working directory.
1. Create a new local feature branch from the release branch.
1. Cherry-pick each commit from Step 1, fixing any conflicts as needed:

```bash
# repeat for each SHA
git cherry-pick <SHA>
```

1. Commit all changes, push the branch, and PR it into the release branch.

### Update the website with release-specific information

    ```
1. Proofread the release notes and do any reordering, rewording, reformatting necessary. Note that you will likely have to delete changelog entries that were not part of this patch release, as well as empty sections in the changelog.
1. Add the new release to the compatibility matrix (`/site/_resources/compatibility-matrix.md`).
1. Document upgrade instructions for the new release (`/site/_resources/upgrading.md`).
1. Add the new release to the compatibility YAML (`/versions.yaml`).

# RC Release process

## Overview

An release-candidate release is e.g. `v1.23.0-rc.1`.

A release-candidate requires:
- a branch off of `main` for the release-candidate
- YAML to be customized
- a release tag to be created
- a GitHub release with release notes
- public communication
- cleanup

## Process

### Set environment variables

Set environment variables for use in subsequent steps:

```bash
export CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION=v1.23.0-rc.1
export CONTOUR_PREVIOUS_VERSION=v1.22.1

export KUBERNETES_MIN_VERSION=1.23
export KUBERNETES_MAX_VERSION=1.25

export CONTOUR_UPSTREAM_REMOTE_NAME=upstream
export CONTOUR_OPERATOR_UPSTREAM_REMOTE_NAME=upstream
```

### Create a branch for the release

Typically we will branch off of `main` to cut an RC of an upcoming release and add the release tag on that branch.
This process is easier than managing a `release-*` branch and having to cherry-pick changes over from `main` for additional commits.

1. Make sure `main` is up to date
1. Create a new local feature branch from `main` (i.e. `release-${CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION}`)
1. Commit all changes, push the branch to `github.com/projectcontour/contour`.

### Generate the RC changelog

1. Ensure the RC branch you created above is clean and up to date.
1. Generate a changelog (the `prepare-release.go` script should detect the version is an RC and only generate a changelog):

    ```bash
    go run ./hack/release/prepare-release.go $CONTOUR_PREVIOUS_VERSION $CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION $KUBERNETES_MIN_VERSION $KUBERNETES_MAX_VERSION
    ```
1. Proofread the release notes and do any reordering, rewording, reformatting necessary.
1. Commit all changes, push the branch to `github.com/projectcontour/contour`.

### Update YAML and tag release

1. Check out the RC branch, ensure it's up to date, and ensure you have a clean working directory.

1. Update the deployment YAML and create a local tag:

```bash
./hack/release/make-release-tag.sh $CONTOUR_PREVIOUS_VERSION $CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION
```

1. Push the branch to `github.com/projectcontour/contour`:

```bash
git push ${CONTOUR_UPSTREAM_REMOTE_NAME} release-${CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION}
```

1. Push the tag to `github.com/projectcontour/contour`:

```bash
git push ${CONTOUR_UPSTREAM_REMOTE_NAME} ${CONTOUR_RELEASE_VERSION}
```

### Do the Github release

Now you have a tag pushed to Github, go to the release tab on github, select the tag and paste in the release notes that were generated previously.

# Release announcements
