# Accessing the Envoy Administration Interface

Getting access to the Envoy [administration interface][1] can be useful for diagnosing issues with routing or cluster health.
However, Contour doesn't expose the entire Envoy Administration interface since that interface contains many options, such as shutting down Envoy or draining traffic.
To prohibit this behavior, Contour only exposes the read-only options from the admin interface which still allows for debugging Envoy, but without the options mentioned previously.

Those endpoints are:
- /certs
- /clusters
- /listeners
- /config_dump
- /memory
- /ready
- /runtime
- /server_info
- /stats
- /stats/prometheus
- /stats/recentlookups

The Envoy administration interface is bound by default to `http://127.0.0.1:9001`.
To access it from your workstation use `kubectl port-forward` like so:

```sh
# Get one of the pods that matches the Envoy daemonset
ENVOY_POD=$(kubectl -n projectcontour get pod -l app=envoy -o name | head -1)
# Do the port forward to that pod
kubectl -n projectcontour port-forward $ENVOY_POD 9001
```

Then navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:9001/` to access the administration interface for the Envoy container running on that pod.
