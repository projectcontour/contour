## Solutions built with Contour

Below is a list of solutions where Contour is being used as a component.

**[Knative](https://knative.dev)**

Knative can use Contour to serve all incoming traffic via the `net-contour` ingress Gateway. The [net-contour](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-contour) controller enables Contour to satisfy the networking needs of Knative Serving by bridging Knative's KIngress resources to Contour's HTTPProxy resources.

**[VMware](https://tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu)**
All four [VMware Tanzu](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/blog/simplify-your-approach-to-application-modernization-with-4-simple-editions-for-the-tanzu-portfolio) editions make the best possible use of various open source projects, starting with putting Kubernetes at their core. Weâ€™ve included leading projects to provide our customers with flexibility and a range of necessary capabilities, including Harbor (for image registry), Antrea (for container networking), Contour (for ingress control), and Cluster API (for lifecycle management).

## Adding a logo to projectcontour.io

If you would like to add your logo to a future `Adopters of Contour` section
of [projectcontour.io][2], add an SVG or PNG version of your logo to the site/img/adopters
directory in this repo and submit a pull request with your change.
Name the image file something that reflects your company
(e.g., if your company is called Acme, name the image acme.png).
We will follow up and make the change in the [projectcontour.io][2] website.
